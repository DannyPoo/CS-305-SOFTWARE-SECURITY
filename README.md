# CS-305-SOFTWARE-SECURITY

The client was Artemeis Financial that had approach us to address the software securiy vulnerability present in their application.
I conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment by manually reviewing the code. I refactored the code to address the identified vulnerabilities, following industry standard best practices for secure coding. I implemened additional layer of security such as input validation, secure authentication, and secure error handling. It is important to code securely because it helps prevent issues of data security breaches and security leaks. These issues can lead to costly case for the company. The challenging aspect for me was trying to find out where the security vulnerability were at so I could I address appropriately.
